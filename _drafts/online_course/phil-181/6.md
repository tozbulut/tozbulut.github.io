There will be two main topics. Platonian Picture, Aristotalian Picture

1. Aristo'nun Mutluluk ve Harmony Ãœzerine Fikirleri, Soul In Order
2. Disordered Soul

Flourising, udemonia = harmony, Plato and Aristotle, we pursue for eudomonia for its own sake. Being the best.

Ancient Idea Of Soul
* Reason (rationality)
* Spirith (Honor, emotions)
* Appetite (Food, Procreation)

Reflective commitments should be inline with reflective comminments.
Instictively, Automaticly acts reflectiveliy. Does the homework, doesnt eaat a chocolate cake. If he or she is committed. 

Nicomachean Ethics

Aristotle's strategy for ordered soul is. Not comes from satisfing lower appetite or demands of spirith and honor. Rather it comes from gratification that making use of
out capacity as reflective beings.

Blade cuts. Human express reason. Souls activity.
Engage in reason. Reflection. Spirith and appetite reflective is your commitments.

* Virtues Of Thought : Pedological. 2 + 2 = 4
* Virtues Of Character : Comes cultivation Of Habit, not from nature not against nature. "We learn to do things by doint them. We learn to be builder by doing." You can't learn it from a book. Only way is by practicing. Just doing by actions. Acting brave actions. You learn to be brave.

Practice can Excess ruins virtue. You need to be at the Aristotelian middle way. Extremes are wrong.
